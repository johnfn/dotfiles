My dotfiles and scripts.
=========

Stuff this gives you:

* `install`: install all these nice utilities

* `git lg`: nice version of git log, condensed, with graph display.

* `fr`: recursively find files matching provided name. 

* `update-dotfiles -m "update message"`: (TODO) grabs all dotfiles in ~ (that you care about) and pushes them to git. (Need a special script for this since you can't have a git directory in ~)
